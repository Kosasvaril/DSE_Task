The purpose of type aliases is to permit the movement of types from one location to another. This implies:\r\n1) that the _real_ name of the type can change over time\r\n2) that there can be multiple names for the exact same Go type\r\n\r\nThe use of type aliases interacts poorly with gob-encoded data stored on disk that represent interface values as `gob` was a developed in an era where there was one-to-one relationship between types and names.\r\n\r\nConsider the following examples.\r\n\r\nAt some point in the past, we [gob-encoded is stored on disk using something like](https://play.golang.org/p/dt0pW47u17P):\r\n```go\r\ntype Rect struct { ... }\r\nfunc (r Rect) Area() int { ... }\r\ntype Any struct {\r\n\tShape interface{ Area() int }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tgob.Register(Rect{})\r\n\r\n\tvar b bytes.Buffer\r\n\te := gob.NewEncoder(&b)\r\n\te.Encode(Shape{Rect{2, 5}})\r\n\t\r\n\t// assume that b is stored on disk\r\n\tfmt.Printf(\"%q\\n\", b.String())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the decoder side, [this works fine with code like](https://play.golang.org/p/GXlOGbcTGvy):\r\n```go\r\ntype Rect struct { ... }\r\nfunc (r Rect) Area() int { ... }\r\ntype Any struct {\r\n\tShape interface{ Area() int }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\t// Assume that the contents of r is loaded from disk as created by:\r\n\t// https://play.golang.org/p/dt0pW47u17P\r\n\tr := strings.NewReader(...)\r\n\r\n\tgob.Register(Rect{})\r\n\r\n\td := gob.NewDecoder(r)\r\n\tv := new(Shape)\r\n\tfmt.Println(d.Decode(v)) // got nil; works as expected\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt some point in the future, [suppose we move `Rect`, now decoding fails](https://play.golang.org/p/6vu43aUdTm-):\r\n```go\r\ntype Rect = Rect2\r\ntype Rect2 struct { ... }\r\nfunc (r Rect2) Area() int { ... }\r\ntype Any struct {\r\n\tShape interface{ Area() int }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\t// Assume that the contents of r is loaded from disk as created by:\r\n\t// https://play.golang.org/p/dt0pW47u17P\r\n\tr := strings.NewReader(...)\r\n\r\n\tgob.Register(Rect{})\r\n\r\n\td := gob.NewDecoder(r)\r\n\tv := new(Shape)\r\n\tfmt.Println(d.Decode(v)) // got error, expected nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the full type name is encoded in the gob wire data. Trying to decode the data at a later date does not know about the movement of the type due to type aliases.\r\n\r\nGiven that problem, one would think that you could just use `gob.RegisterName` to manually register the old name:\r\n```go\r\ngob.RegisterName(Rect{})\r\ngob.RegisterName(\"main.Rect\", Rect{})\r\n```\r\nHowever, that panics with:\r\n```\r\npanic: gob: registering duplicate names for main.Rect2: \"main.Rect2\" != \"main.Rect\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI propose the following changes:\r\n1) That `gob` be better documented about the interaction of type aliases and serialization of interface values.\r\n2) That `gob.RegisterName` be relaxed to permit duplicate names. However, this can cause confusion in the implementation as to which name to use when marshaling. Alternatively, we could add a `gob.RegisterAlias` that makes it clear that the duplicate names are aliases."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2020-01-01T00:41:06Z","org":{"id":4314092,"login":"golang","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/golang","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4314092?"}}
